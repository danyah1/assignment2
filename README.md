## Dataset Summary
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic ship, such as age, gender, passenger class, ticket fare, and whether they survived.
The dataset has 891 rows and 12 columns.


## Machine Learning Problem
The goal of this dataset is to predict passenger survival using the Survived column:
- 0 → Did not survive  
- 1 → Survived  
This is a binary classification problem in machine learning.


## Notebook Work
In this assignment, the dataset was loaded using Pandas and basic exploration was performed, including:
- Displaying the dataset shape  
- Viewing the first rows using head()  
- Checking column information using info()  
- Creating a simple visualization of survival counts
